# websocket-example
We have built the server and client that connects to our WebSocket server and receives messages from the server. The message will contain the total connection count from the server.

1. Type the following command that will install a WebSocket server. We need to install it into server directory:

`npm install --save ws`

2. Type the following command to execute the server:

`node server.js`

You should get the following result if this works:

`$ node server.js`

WebSocket server is running.

Listening to port 8000.
